# RSA-Wiener-Attack
This project implements Wiener's attack to exploit the vulnerability in RSA when the private exponent \(d\) is small. The script finds the private key \(d\) using continued fractions and then decrypts a given ciphertext. This project demonstrates the potential risks of using small private keys in RSA encryption.
